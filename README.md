# Business Model
1.CoffeeToken (CFT) Ecosystem
CoffeeToken is a decentralized loyalty and supply chain solution that creates a "win-win-win" scenario for consumers, coffee shop owners, and suppliers.
* For Consumers: Access to a 10% cashback/discount and a unique loyalty asset ($CFT).

* For Coffee Shops: Ability to purchase high-quality coffee beans at prices lower than the market average by using $CFT.

* For the Platform: Sustainable revenue through transaction fees and ecosystem growth.

2.The Circular Economy 
* Funding Phase: Users contribute ETH to the Crowdfunding contract to support the network's growth.
* Token Issuance: In return, users automatically receive $CFT (ERC-20) tokens.
* Consumer Utility: Users spend $CFT at partner coffee shops. Each purchase grants a 10% cashback in tokens, incentivizing repeat visits.
