# Summary of Business Model:
We aren't just building an app; we are investing nearly half of our budget ($20,000+) into real coffee beans. This means our project is backed by actual products sitting in our warehouse in Astana. Unlike 'software-only' startups, your investment is tied to a real-world product that people buy and drink every single day. It’s safer, simpler, and much more grounded.
